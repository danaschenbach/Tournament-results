# Tournament-results
Another wonderful Udaciuty school project. For this project we had to write a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database.

# Getting started
First you will need to have the different software installed;
1. Python2 or better, if you don't have it installed here's a link https://www.python.org/downloads/,
  once there you can pick which version is right for you. But keep in mind this was written with Python2.
2. Download the 3 files in the repository
3. Vagrant & VirtualBox, these can be tricky to install, so here's another link that will walk you through
  the install https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004/parts/af045689-1d81-46e7-8a3b-     ad05de1142ce/modules/353202897075460/lessons/3423258756/concepts/14c72fe3-e3fe-4959-9c4b-467cf5b7c3a0
4. And here's a link to explain in detail how to run https://docs.google.com/document/d/16IgOm4XprTaKxAa8w02y028oBECOoB1EI1ReddADEeY/pub?embedded=true
